<!-- # CY Building Blocks and OOTS -->

Connecting Digital Services (CDS) is an initiative that brings together Software as a Service (SaaS) applications to streamline the development and operation of government digital services in Cyprus. By applying common policies, standards, and principles, CDS promotes uniformity across various governmental services, ensuring efficiency and reducing costs in both time and implementation.

The following building blocks are relevant to the OOTS integration:

## Identity and Digital Signatures
### CY Login / eIDAS
CY Login serves as the identity management system for both citizens and organizations requiring access to government digital services. A robust and secure digital identity is key to delivering user-centred, reliable services. This system ensures that the identity verification process is seamless and user-friendly, fostering trust and ease of access.

## Integration
### CY Connect
In alignment with the “Once Only” principle, CY Connect facilitates data exchange between interconnected government systems. Citizens and organizations can provide their data once, and it will be used seamlessly across services. This integration promotes smoother transactions, reduces bureaucracy, and enhances the overall efficiency of government services.

## Notification
### CY Notify
Designed to facilitate direct communication, CY Notify allows government services to send SMS and email notifications to users. Whether for individual or bulk messaging, this system is an easy, cost-effective solution for informing citizens about important updates, deadlines, or service notifications.
